Skip & Cal
==========

This repository contains the source code for [skipandcal.net](http://skipandcal.net), a web repository of my cartoons and comics.

This website uses the [Ruby on Rails 3.2](http://rubyonrails.org/) web development framework and the [ZURB Foundation 2](http://foundation.zurb.com/) web design framework. The site itself is happily hosted on [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com/).

Feel free to make use of the code as you see fit (except to hack the site).

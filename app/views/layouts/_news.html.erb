	<h5>News and Updates</h5>
	<p>Welcome to my little cartoon and comics archive site! Since it's just getting going, things might be a little rough around the edges. I'll be gradually improving the experience.</p>
	<p>I'm currently in the process of uploading my entire archive of work for the <i>Cardinal Courier</i> from 2007 to 2011, along with a few other goodies. So bear with me 'til we get to the better stuff. ;)</p>
	<p>If you want to get updates for new uploads, follow <a style="color: #357A24;" href="http://twitter.com/SkipandCal">Skip and Cal on Twitter</a>. I'm working on getting an RSS feed going too, for those who enjoy such things.</p>
	<p>Thanks for visiting! I hope you enjoy!</p>
